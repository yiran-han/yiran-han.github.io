Abstract: More than 18% of US adults meet the diagnostic criteria for a mental illness. Yet, many who could benefit from mental health care do not receive any treatment, primarily due to inability to pay for care or lack of health insurance coverage. How does a change in health insurance coverage affect psychological well-being and mental health? We explore this question using age-based health insurance coverage policies in the United States as natural experiments. We provide evidence that losing health insurance coverage at the age 26 due to aging out from dependent coverage is associated with a statistically significant deterioration in certain mental health indicators and psychological well-being among young adults. On the other hand, we find no evidence of an improvement in mental health or psychological well-being among the elderly at the age 65 due to becoming eligible for Medicare. These results are robust to potential changes in risk-taking behavior and physical health at the same age cutoffs.
