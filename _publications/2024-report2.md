Abstract: The Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act ([CRTA], Public Act 101-0027) supports the use of funds allocated to the Illinois Department of Human Services (IDHS) Division of Substance Use Prevention and Recovery (SUPR) and the Division of Mental Health Services (DMH) to evaluate the public health impacts of legalizing adult cannabis use in the state. The current report is the fourth in a series of annual reports in fulfillment of the CRTAâ€™s statutory report requirement. The report covers the period between July 2023 and June 2024 and presents and summarizes analyses of data obtained from a wide variety of sources covering an equally comprehensive array of public health-related areas associated with cannabis use and Illinois cannabis policy. Emerging topics such as perinatal cannabis use, awareness and use of synthetic cannabis (i.e., delta-8 THC) made from hemp, and cannabis hyperemesis syndrome are covered as well as updates to topics covered in prior reports such as prevalence, initiation of use, traffic fatalities, reasons for purchasing cannabis from illicit sources, and reasons for use among persons registered in the medical cannabis program compared with non-medical cannabis users.
