abstract: 'This chapter investigates the characteristics of labour demanding during the post–Covid-19 period in China. We extract information from the recruitment advertisements in online job portals. We find that the job requirements vary across sectors for the potential employees. The candidates’ background, relevant knowledge and professional skills are more important in the technology and finance industries. The common skills required are communication, execution and marketing skills. Secondly, the technology industry hires the most people among all industries, especially in metropolis areas. Our findings imply that during the post-pandemic period of Covid-19, the technology industry draws more and more attention. The government and universities could provide more courses to fulfil the requirements of the high-demand industry.'
