I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the [University at Albany, State University of New York](https://www.albany.edu/).

My research interests include Health Economics and Public Health, especially the relationship between individual behaviors and physician prescribing and Medicare Part D.

I am on the job market during the 2024-2025 academic year.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Pinka Chatterji](https://pinkachatterji.com/) and [Prof. Chun-Yu Ho](https://sites.google.com/site/chunyuho/). 

You can find my CV here: [Yiran Han's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV_Yiran_Han_academic.pdf).
